# Distressed Property Outreach Automation  
*2025 AI Property Insights Hackathon (BatchData)*  
**Author:** _Alfonso Hernandez_

This project automates the workflow for identifying distressed properties, skip-tracing property owners, and generating personalized outreach messages using AI. It is designed for real estate investors, wholesalers, and solo operators who want fast, repeatable lead processing without manual effort.

The notebook pulls targeted property data from BatchData, performs skip-trace lookups to retrieve owner contact information, filters out phone numbers on Do Not Call lists, and uses OpenAI to generate compliant outreach templates (email, phone script, and letter copy).  
Results can be exported to CSV for outbound dialers, mail merge, CRM ingestion, AWS SES / Connect, print mailers, etc.
